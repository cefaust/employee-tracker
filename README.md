# employee-tracker

### Description 
With this project I was tasked with creating a commandline application that will allow a user to view and manage departments, roles and employees in their company. This will allow the user to plan and organize their business. 

### Things I included in this project
1. When the user starts the application they are presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, 
add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update the employee role.
2. When the user selects view all departments, they are then presented with a formatted table showing department names
and department ids.
3. When the user selects view all roles, they are presented with the job title, role id, the department that the role 
belongs to, and the salary of that role.
4. When the user selects view all employees, they are presented with a formatted table showing the employee data, 
including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and manager that the employee reports to.
5. When the user chooses to add a department, they are prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added
to the database.
6. When the user chooses to add a role, then they are prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that
role is added to the database.
7. When the user chooses to add an employee, they are prompted to add the employee's first name, last name, role, and manager.
That employee will then be added to the database.
8. When the user chooses to update the employee role, they are prompted to select an employee and their new role and this information
is updated to the database.
